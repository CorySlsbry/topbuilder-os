-- The bug this exists to prevent (found live 2026-07-24): billing_events had
-- no SELECT grant for app_user. Inside the export's single transaction that
-- one permission error aborted the whole transaction, and the per-table
-- catch swallowed it — so the ZIP shipped 4 tables out of 34 and the customer
-- would never have known their books were missing.
--
-- The code fix is savepoints + catalog discovery. This is the other half:
-- every tenant-scoped table must be readable by app_user, or be on the
-- explicit plumbing allowlist. Add a table, forget the grant, this fails.
