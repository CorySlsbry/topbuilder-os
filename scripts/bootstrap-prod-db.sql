-- Bootstrap the production database roles.
--
-- Run ONCE as the `postgres` superuser against a fresh Cloud SQL instance,
-- BEFORE migrations. Migrations then run as postgres (they create policies and
-- revoke grants, which the app role must never be able to do), and the app
-- connects only ever as app_user.
--
-- The whole tenant-isolation guarantee rests on two properties of this role:
--   1. NOSUPERUSER  — a superuser silently ignores RLS.
--   2. NOBYPASSRLS  — the explicit form of the same guarantee.
-- If either is lost, every RLS policy in the schema becomes decorative. The
-- verification block at the bottom refuses to finish if that is the case.
--
-- Usage (through the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy, so nothing is exposed publicly):
--   psql "host=127.0.0.1 port=5433 user=postgres dbname=topbuilder" \
--     -v app_password="'<from Secret Manager>'" -f scripts/bootstrap-prod-db.sql

\set ON_ERROR_STOP on

-- The application role. No CREATEDB, no CREATEROLE, no superuser, no bypass.
