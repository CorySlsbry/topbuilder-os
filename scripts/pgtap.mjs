/**
 * Runs every `test/db/*.test.sql` pgTAP suite against the local Postgres
 * container. Cross-platform (Node + `docker exec`), so it works the same
 * locally and in CI.
 *
 *   pnpm test:db
 *
 * ⚠️ This runner USED TO FAIL OPEN, and did so silently for real commits.
 *
 * It counted `not ok` lines and failed only when it found one. A file that
 * aborted on its FIRST statement produced no `ok` lines and no `not ok` lines,
 * so it reported "0 assertions, 0 failed" and the run ended in "all passed".
 * That is exactly what happened to 0020_financial_depth.test.sql after
 * migration 0028 dropped `payroll_runs`: six real assertions — append-only
 * enforcement and cross-tenant isolation among them — stopped running, and
 * every "pgTAP: all passed" afterwards was a lie.
 *
 * The rule now: a suite must run EXACTLY the number of assertions it declared
 * in `plan(N)`, that number must be > 0, and any psql ERROR fails the run.
 * Absence of failure is not evidence of success — you have to count.
