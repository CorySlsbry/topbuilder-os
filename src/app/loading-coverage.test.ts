/**
 * ⛔ EVERY CLIENT PAGE THAT FETCHES ON MOUNT SHOWS A WIREFRAME WHILE IT LOADS.
 *
 * The skeleton system shipped across 26 screens and four were missed. Missing
 * one is invisible in review — the page works, it just blinks blank first —
 * and it is worst exactly where it matters most: `/field` is used on a roof on
 * bad signal, and `/portal/[token]` is a customer's first impression of the
 * business.
 *
 * So coverage is asserted rather than remembered. A new page that fetches on
 * mount and forgets its loading state fails the build.
 *
 * Exemptions are LISTED WITH A REASON, not inferred. "It doesn't need one" has
 * to be a decision somebody wrote down, because that is exactly the sentence
 * that hides the four this test was written to find.

/**

 * an ordinary flex ITEM in the sidebar+content row — taking ~1000px, shoving
 * the sidebar to the right edge, and collapsing the page content to ZERO
 * width. The whole app rendered as an empty page on every desktop viewport,
 * on the PUBLIC DEMO, and nothing caught it because the bar only renders for
 * the demo seat or a 2FA prompt.
 *

 * mode is not a no-op you can leave lying around — it is a silent lie about
 * what the element will do.
