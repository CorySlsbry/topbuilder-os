/**
 * "Download everything" — STREAMED, not buffered.
 *
 * ── What was wrong with the old one ───────────────────────────────────────
 * `exportEverything` read every tenant table fully into memory, built a
 * complete CSV string for each, concatenated the whole archive, and then
 * copied it again into a Buffer for the response. Four copies of a shop's
 * entire history, on a Cloud Run instance with 1 GiB.
 *
 * It worked, because it was only ever tested against a demo tenant with a few
 * hundred rows. The first real shop with a couple of years of `journal_lines`
 * would have OOM-killed the instance — and the request that does it is
 * "give me my data", the one request that must never fail, because a customer
 * doing it is often a customer leaving.
 *
 * ── The shape now ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * One server-side CURSOR per table, a batch of rows at a time, CSV encoded and
 * pushed straight into a streaming zip. Peak memory is one batch — a few
 * hundred rows — no matter how big the business is.
 *
 * The transaction is held open by `streamWithTenant` for the life of the
 * download, READ ONLY, with the tenant GUCs set by the same code path every
 * other query uses.
