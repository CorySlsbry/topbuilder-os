/**
 * "Should a first-load skeleton be on screen right now?"
 *
 * Three rules, each preventing one specific ugly thing. They are small enough
 * to read in one sitting and they replace what a data-fetching library would
 * otherwise be dragged in to do.
 *
 *  1. LATCH — once `ready` has been true once, this returns false forever.
 *     Without it, the `act()` idiom used on nine screens (`finally { setBusy(false);
 *     await load(); }`) would re-arm the skeleton after EVERY save and the whole
 *     page would strobe on each write. The same latch is why a screen reader
 *     hears "Loading…" once per visit instead of once per mutation. One rule,
 *     both problems.
 *
 *  2. DELAY — nothing shows for the first `delayMs`. A skeleton that flashes
 *     for 40ms is worse than none, and on a warm connection most screens in
 *     this app will never show one at all. That is the correct outcome, not a
 *     missing feature.
 *
 *  3. FLOOR — once shown, it stays for `minMs`. Otherwise a response landing
 *     just past the delay produces exactly the flash rule 2 exists to avoid.
 *
 * ── Where NOT to use this ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Anywhere the indicator must fire again for a SECOND item: opening another
 * inbox thread, asking another question. The latch is wrong there by design —
 * use a plain `busy` boolean. Both call sites say so in their own comments.
