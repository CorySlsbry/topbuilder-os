/**
 * Request-level idempotency: the same request twice has the effect of once.
 *
 * The case this exists for is not exotic. A contractor on one bar of signal
 * taps "Record payment", sees nothing happen, and taps again. Without this,
 * that is two payments and two journal entries against one bill. The books
 * still balance — they are simply wrong, and it surfaces weeks later as a bank
 * reconciliation that will not tie, which is the most expensive way to find a
 * bug in accounting software.
 *
 * Storage-layer uniqueness (payments.reference, bill_payments.provider_ref,
 * agent_actions.idempotency_key) already covers paths with a natural key. This
 * covers everything else, which was 65 of 66 mutating routes.
 *
 * ── Protocol ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   claim (own transaction, so it survives a crash in the work)
 *     → run the handler
 *       → record the response against the key
 *
 * Replay outcomes:
 *   completed   → the ORIGINAL response, verbatim. A retry is indistinguishable
 *                 from the first call, which is the whole point.
 *   in_progress → 409 idempotent_replay_in_progress. Two clicks genuinely
 *                 raced; the second must not execute.
 *   handler threw → the key is RELEASED. A key burned by a transient database
 *                 error would be worse than no idempotency at all: the user
 *                 could never complete the action.
 *
 * A key reused with a different body is a client bug (usually a key generated
 * once and never rotated) and returns 422 rather than silently replaying a
 * response for a request the caller did not make.
