/**
 * A STREAMING zip writer — pure, no dependency, no buffering of the archive.
 *
 * ── Why the existing `buildZip` could not just be reused ──────────────────
 * `buildZip` takes every entry's full content as a string and returns the
 * whole archive as one `Uint8Array`. That is correct and fine for a CPA pack
 * of a dozen small reports. It is the wrong shape for "download my entire
 * business": a shop with a few years of `journal_lines` produces a CSV far
 * larger than the 1 GiB this service runs in, and the old path held it THREE
 * times over — the rows, the CSV string, and the finished archive.
 *
 * ── The format detail that makes streaming possible ───────────────────────
 * A local file header must state the CRC and the compressed/uncompressed size
 * BEFORE the data. When you are streaming you do not know any of them yet.
 *
 * The zip spec's answer is the DATA DESCRIPTOR: set bit 3 of the general
 * purpose flag, write zeros in the header, then write the real CRC and sizes
 * in a 16-byte trailer AFTER the data. Every unzip implementation of the last
 * twenty-five years reads it — it is how every "download as zip" endpoint on
 * the internet works.
 *
 * STORE (no compression) is deliberate, same as `buildZip`. CSV compresses
 * beautifully, and adding DEFLATE would mean either a dependency or a
 * hand-rolled compressor in the path that hands a customer their own books.
 * Bandwidth is cheaper than that risk.
 *
 * ── ⛔ THE 4 GiB / 65,535-FILE CEILING, AND WHY IT THROWS ─────────────────
 * This writes classic zip, whose sizes and offsets are 32-bit and whose file
 * count is 16-bit. Going past any of them does not produce an error in the
 * format — it produces a SILENTLY WRONG archive, because the value simply
 * wraps. The doc above notes that a few years of `journal_lines` already
 * exceeds a gigabyte, so this is a reachable limit, not a theoretical one;
 * add job photos and 4 GiB is an ordinary export.
 *
 * A customer discovering their books are corrupt is a far worse outcome than
 * a customer told the export is too large, because they discover it later —
 * usually while migrating to whatever they left us for. So every field that
 * can overflow is checked, and the stream fails loudly instead.
 *
 * The real fix is ZIP64 (64-bit extra fields plus a ZIP64 end-of-central-
 * directory record). It is not written here because it cannot be honestly
 * verified without generating multi-gigabyte fixtures and testing against
 * real unzip implementations — and shipping an unverified ZIP64 writer into
 * the data-export path would reintroduce exactly the silent corruption these
 * guards exist to prevent.
