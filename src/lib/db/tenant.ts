/**
 * The same tenant scope, but for a response that STREAMS.
 *
 * ── Why this exists at all ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `withTenant` owns the connection for exactly as long as `fn` runs, which is
 * the right shape for every request that computes an answer and returns it. A
 * streamed response inverts that: the handler returns immediately and the rows
 * are still being read minutes later, so the transaction has to outlive the
 * function that opened it.
 *
 * ⛔ It lives HERE, next to `withTenant`, on purpose. This is the one piece of
 * code in the system that opens a tenant-scoped transaction by hand, and the
 * failure mode if it is wrong is not a crash — it is a query running with NO
 * `app.current_tenant`, which RLS answers with somebody else's silence or,
 * worse, nothing at all. Putting it in the export module would have hidden a
 * security-critical lifecycle inside a feature.
 *
 * The contract, which the caller cannot opt out of:
 *   - the scope is set with the SAME `setScope` the normal path uses
 *   - the transaction is READ ONLY, so a streaming reader cannot write
 *   - the connection is released exactly once, on completion OR cancellation
 *     OR error — a browser closing the tab mid-download must not leak a
 *     connection out of a pool this small
